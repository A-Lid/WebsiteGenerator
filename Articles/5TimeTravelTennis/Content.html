            Time Travel Tennis was a game I made whilst working at Trunk. It was a Mobile Game for Adroid and IOS. For the first few months of development, I worked in a 2 man development team, one artist one programmer, with others coming in here and there to support the project and guide it's direction.

    Being my first Mobile title, I learnt a lot on it about mobile development, but I also learnt a lot about working in a full studio enviroment. My University course, whilst it does it's best to emulate a studio enviroment will never capture the full experience.

    My role consisted mostly of UI/UX programming, gameplay design and programming, and some minor writing. Working with closely with Josh Pearson was a great experience, his talent and adaptability really allowing us to work very effectively as a two man team.

    I can't say too much about the game itself as it is still under active development. In terms of my approach to programming, it was really a turning point. Everything before had been for learning or for marks. I really enjoyed the time I spent working on it, and I'm looking forward for when it gets released.

            Vocal Percussion is a short little game I made in the series of games. The challenge I set myself was to design some games that had no tutorials, and could just be played to get a sense of what you had to do. This one is based around sound, providing a visual output for the microphone input. The Waveform serves as the player, and they have to avoid red squares and pick up pink squares.

    A lot of the challenge in this project came from working with audio. Audio is something that I’ve used before, but not for input or graphical output. My project started with me building the Waveform Generator. For this I used a placeholder Audio Clip, so as not to worry about input just yet. I used a line renderer to draw out the peaks, which were sampled at a variable rate. This worked fine, but didn’t look quite right. Looking at other Waveforms, I saw that they Mirrored it, so I doubled the length of the line renderer and used an algorithm to make it draw the inverse underneath, resulting in a more traditional method. I used an edge collider, and matched up the edges to the point of the line renderer at run time.

    Microphone Input was a lot easier than I had expected. Unity contained classes for working with Microphones, including multiple. I made it default to the first microphone available, and output as an audio clip. This made it loop round the clip, writing it over a one second period. This wasn’t ideal as it resulted in it moving across the screen. I had to think about this for a while, as I wanted it moving from left to right. I then realised if I wanted it moving left to right, I’d need to reverse the sound. When working in a software like audacity, it does move from left to right, but that’s because you start at 0 and leave your audio behind. So instead I need to have the audio move from right to left, like it’s being left behind. To change this I could either poll the current microphone input and add it to a list, or just transpose the audio clip to keep the re-recorded bit at the right end of the screen. I decided that transposing would be more accurate to what I wanted to make.

    Playtesting the project, it worked really well. When someone boots it up, they don’t know what to do, but usually there will be some background noise to that’ll make its way into the wave form. This teaches the player that they can affect the waveform with sound, which will then inspire them to make more sound. The colour red is generally avoided in games, and will become clear when hitting one with the background number going down. The pink is the main colour of the line, which implies it won’t be as bad as the red, and on hit will make the number in the background go up.

    I’m very happy with it overall, it’s a short but sweet game designed more for the fun of discovery than the fun of playing. I’m not 100%, but I think I’ll make it end after collected 10 points, which should be 3-5 minutes of gameplay.

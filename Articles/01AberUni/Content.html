            I've been working in the applications team in the university for the past 2 years, as of writing.  I work with the CRM, the data surrounding it in and out, and supporting users to be able to use it for the needs they have within the university.

    Much of my work is about dealing with data. We use Oracle and Microsoft Databases, so I have to use a mix of Oracle and MS SQL in my day to day. For most of our data transfers, we process the data through Powershell as one might use Python or Bash. I write ETLs to transfer data between the different databases, using a bespoke in house ETL system.

    I work with non technical staff, developing within the CRM for their needs and supporting them to use the CRM to the full potential. Much of this is specifically with the Dynamics Customer Insights â€“ Journeys (formerly Marketing module) with our Marketing team to promote the university to applicants and potential applicants.

    Apex Forms and CRM Marketing forms are used for outreach. I've worked on Validator processes for these so that we collect better data. Validating data at the point it's collected means that it can be corrected. The validator processes use an internal webrequest process, which means we can use them from SQL, JavaScript and Powershell as we need, allowing easier maintenance of code.

    My job, as I was split between the tools and publishing teams, my role was split. In my publishing side, I supported the external games that we published. This meant liaising with external developers throughout the lifespan of the game, from how to implement our bespoke SDK, to answering technical queries they had, and helping fix bugs highlighted by QA. Towards the end of a games life, the bug fixing would be taken over by us in house.

    In the tools side, there was a lot of maintaining old games, investigating new technologies, maintaining the build servers and working on the submodules we used in games. Our SDK was a form of these submodules that we compiled to obfuscate the code. The submodules enabled the company to have such a rapid turn around on the games created, which is the backbone of Kwalee's success.

    Working in a games company was a unique experience. It was a rapid, agile environment, and I had a lot of fun and learnt a lot about structures. If the situation presents itself, I would be interested in working in the games industry again. I think it would be interesting to take what I've learnt since and apply it back.

            CrowScare is a game I made as part of a collection of games about intuitive controls. The collection is designed for mobile, so I’m thinking about what a player might do when they don’t know what to do. One of the first things they'll do is tap the screen, so this game is based entirely around tapping the screen.

    There’s a circle of Scarecrows that slowly move towards a crow in the center. When the player holds on the screen, two circles appear, one growing one not. On release, the Crow Squawks, scaring the Scarecrows away. Depending on how close the circles are, the further it scares the Scarecrows.

    I wanted to make this game as simple as possible. It can be easy to have an overreliance on Unity’s components, and in this project I wanted to avoid that. I started making a slow blink that slowly got faster and faster, which obfuscated the screen. I added in a scarecrow that would move towards the centre in the time that it was hidden. After getting this right, I made it spawn in a number more skeletons, which I could adjust.

    My next step was making the circle input. I decided to use an unclamped lerp to start at a small size and increase until and beyond the greater circle size. One issue I ran into was the speed of growth was slower for the bigger sizes. Making it proportional was important to balancing the game, if it was faster at lower sizes, and slower at bigger sizes, it would be a greater disparity in reactions needed.

    When I was coming up up ideas for this series of games, I was sitting outside and decided I wanted to make a game about birds. So I wrote down a list of what they did which consisted of: flying, swimming and squawking, so I made a game about squawking and scaring scare crows. It’s definitely the least intuitive in the little series of three, but I don’t think it missed its mark too much has been my favourite to work on.

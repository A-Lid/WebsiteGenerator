    Fencing is a big hobby of mine, I've been fencing Foil since 2015. I don't fence competitively, though I have been to a few competitions. I really enjoy it, focussing on having fun in the match than necessarily going for winning. It's an interesting sport, with a diverse range of people interested in it.

    In 2018/2019, I was voted in as secretary of my University Fencing Club, second to the chairman. I worked with the chairman and the committee to promote fencing throughout the year. In the next academic year, 2019/2020, I became the Chairman, managed the club with my committee. I really enjoyed these experiences, as I had the opportunity to promote fencing to so many more people.

    In addition, I got my Level 1 Foil Teaching qualification in 2018, which allowed me to teach students how to fence foil. I find teaching fencing really fulfilling, and I'm always filled with a sense of pride when my students do well.

            The Beast Mythos is a game that I am working on in a team over my third year. It’s a Dark Souls/Monster Hunter inspired game with a heavy focus on fighting in dangerous situations. We utilise GOAP to give the creature’s an intense reactive move set, and we craft the environment to interact with the beast and present additional complexities in the fight.

    This game is a third person action RPG game in a fantasy setting.
    It takes inspiration from Dark Souls and Monster Hunter, following similar designs with large monsters to fight along with a strategic moveset to fight them with.
    We are a 6 man team, with an even split of programmers and artists, each having a specialisation within our roles. My specialisation is gameplay and player facing systems.
    <br>
    <br>

    As Lead Programmer on the project, I’ve spent a lot of my time managing and designing aspects of the game.
    The bulk of my programming on the game has been based around player facing aspects, such as the player controller, the feedback handler and the combo system.
    These aspects of the game are vital to get right.

    <h2>Player Feedback</h2>
    <hr>
    The player feedback was an interesting bit of the project, and something I'd like to highlight. The aim of the system was for any other systems to be able to access it,
    not just combat. The script consists of three major components, the vibration of the controller, the shaking of the camera and the knockback on the player. Keeping these systems
    together makes sense due to the similar nature of their executions and their purposes within the game.

    <br>
    <br>
    The first challenge was controller vibration. This isn't supported in Unity by default, and not even with the new Input Manager. Apparently it's a feature that's been on the
    "coming soon" list for a while, but hasn't materialised yet. I looked for a solution, but best I could find was suggestions of just buying a package from the store to do it.
    It would've been simple, but it would've been an extra expense and not really taught me anything. I managed to find a reference to an old open source package called
    "XInputDotNetPure" which gave support to XInput in Unity. Two issues arose though, number one the package was from Unity 2017, and we were on Unity 2019, and it only supported
    360 Controllers from what we tested. But I tried it, and the setup was very simple.

    <br>
    <br>

    It takes three parameters, the controller, the left vibrate and the right vibrate. Pretty simple, but limiting. As it was the best solution I was going to get, I ignored
    the issue of only supporting 360 controllers, and remarkably it was working well with Unity 2019, bar one little detail. Exiting play mode would crash Unity. I wish I could
    claim some masterfull debugging for this, but I just went to the settings, had a look at what stood out and changed the CPU mode and it stopped happening. The next problem was
    that the only way to stop it vibrating, was to set the vibes to 0. So I built a function to control this a lot more precisely.

    <img class="img-fluid" src="Pictures/CodeSnippets/GoodVibes.PNG" height="211" width="709"/><br>
    <br>

    Essentially, this takes the left, the right, as before, but also takes a time and a bool for whether it diminishes. I used a simple system to create a timer, getting
    the timeSinceLevelLoad, adding the duration to that, and then evaulating whether the timeSinceLevelLoad is greater than the when the timer started + duration. Very
    rudimentary but it gets the job done. This is essentially a section that sets everything up, and it assess it on update.

    <br><img class="img-fluid" src="Pictures/CodeSnippets/AssessVibes.PNG" height="357" width="847"/>
    <br>
    So as mentioned, it will assess the timer, and return the vibration to nill if nothing is happening. Then it checks if it's diminishing, and if so will remap the
    vibration amount from where the vibration started at to 0. This means that it will linearly decrease across the defined duration. This is good for a sudden hit being
    quick snappy vibration, whilst a longer hit, such as a burning attack, would be a longer more drawn out vibration. This degree of customizabilty is fairly simple to look at,
    but is absoulutely needed whilst working on the game. Giving attacks different vibrations allows the player to haptically tell the difference between them, which is an
    often underrated aspect of feedback.

    The Project is only in the greybox stage, and development is still active.
    For me, it’s a chance to learn new skills such as with the High Definition Render Pipeline.
    It’s unusual to work on a project so long in a university setting. This allows us to work closer to an industry standard, utilising things such as programming tools for our own uses.

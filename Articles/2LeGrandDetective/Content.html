            Le Grand Detective De Souris was one my favourite projects to work on. The concept was essentially a Noir Parkour Game, where the player had to solve a mystery. We wanted to parody the genre by playing everything as straight as possible, except you are a mouse named Big Cheese. Big Cheese Is a retired detective who is called in for one final case. It turned out that his missing-presumed-dead wife was behind this all along, threatening to blow up the cheese factory.

    In terms of gameplay we wanted something similar to Mirror’s Edge, fast paced parkour, but we specifically wanted to have divergent routes. Level design was tough on with this game, being our first game that really relied on it. A big thing about this game was that as a restraint from our lecturers we were not allowed to use animated 3D Models with Unity’s animator. My part of the project consisted primarily with creating an animation system for the player’s arms. Whilst this may seem like reinventing the wheel, it taught me a lot about animation, and even though I wasn’t using it, Unity’s animator.

    In addition, I worked a lot on bug fixes, QA and gameplay here and there in the project. I also had my first experience with sound implementation. I used FMOD for this and the entire process was new to me. It was a lot of fun to implement these sounds and really helped bring the game to life. Due to some a member of the team dropping out part way through, I ended up doing the voice acting for all three characters. This resulted in hurried attempts to learn a French accent which to this day is not very good.

    Overall the project was a lot of fun and I had a lot of fun working on it. It’s very rough around the edges in places but was really a labour of love and it’s to be expected in an ambitious early university project. Big Cheese’s story got expanded upon by the rest of the group in another project while I was on industry placement, but I still managed to get time in to voice Big Cheese.

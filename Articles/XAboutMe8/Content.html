    <p> I'm Aled, and I've been working on Games for the last 3 years. I started programming when I was 14, with a computer with no internet access learning from a book. At 16 I went to college, and got a Certificate in Computer Science. I moved onto University of Salford, where I currently am Studying Games Design and Development in my third year. </p>

    <!--My name is Aled Pink. I’m a Gameplay programmer with focus on User Experience. I’m quite versatile, with a versatile Computer Science background. I’ve mostly worked with C# and Unity, but I’ve also had experience with C++, Java, Python and Web Development, both backend and frontend. I find it quite easy to pick up new languages due to the array of languages I know. I’m currently attending Salford University for Games Design and Production.
    <br><br>
    I also enjoy some more creative work. I’ve got experience working with Photoshop and Illustrator, with a bit less experience with Premier Pro and After Effects. I try to work technicality into my personal art projects. One example is using TIFFs to open a picture as an Audio file, and apply audio effects to it, and then converting them back into images. This meant I could hide audio in images, or distort images in a controller “glitchy” way.
    <br><br>
    Another fun one was making a clock. I’d been reading Thief of Time, a book by Terry Pratchett, and I took inspiration from the shattered clock that is at the book’s core. I built an infinity mirror, a two way mirror faced at a mirror with LED’s around the outside. I changed the colour of these LEDs to act as hands on a clock. I built a frame from bike wheels, and suspended gears around it. One of the mirrors was smashed, and it looked great. Horribly impractical, but pretty. I used an Arduino to control it, and as my first electronics project it was very successful, and I only managed to brick one Arduino.
    <br><br>
    In terms of Hobbies, I really enjoy hiking, and just anything outdoors really. I used to spend a lot of time mountain biking, but living in Manchester, there aren’t many mountains. North Wales is one of my favourite places for hiking and mountain biking, the geography there is just stunning.
